## Abstract

GRAPH stands for Guidelines and Resources to Advance Protocols for Hackerspaces. A GRAPH is a document providing information and documentation for new or improved business and/or technical protocols for Bitcoin Hackerspace Network. As the Bitcoin Hackerspace Network starts and grows, new business and technical protocols must be developed to accommodate current and new member spaces. GRAPHs will serve as the primary mechanism for proposing new business and technical protocols for the Bitcoin Hackerspace Network.

If the GRAPH is a technical protocol, it should provide a concise technical specification of and a rationale for the new feature. If the GRAPH is a business protocol, it should provide concise guidelines, resources and rationale for the new feature. The GRAPH author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the GRAPHs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

It is highly recommended that a single GRAPH contain a single key proposal or new idea. More focused GRAPHs will tend to be more successful. If in doubt, a GRAPH should be split into several well-focused ones.
